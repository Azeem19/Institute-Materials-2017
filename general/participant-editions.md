# Digital editions by Institute participants

The following are selected editions prepared by members of our Institute. We define *digital edition* as ‘the digital publication of a text with editorial enhancement’. This is a broader definition than that employed by some other scholars within the digital editions community, such as [Patrick Sahle](http://www.digitale-edition.de/vlet-about.html) and [Greta Franzini](https://github.com/gfranzini/digEds_cat/wiki), whose focus is more specifically on editions that analyze variation during textual transmission. Institute participants are encouraged to contribute links for inclusion in this page, as a way of documenting the interests and accomplishments of our Institute community.

[Amadis in translation](http://amadis.newtfire.org) is a bit of an experiment to see if my colleague and I can figure out *how much* an English nineteenth-century translator (Robert Southey) changed the sixteenth-century text of Amadis that he was translating. We’re preparing an edition (though the interface is not ready yet), but part of the goal is to highlight where semantic “chunks” of text line up with one another. You can see some graphs on the site that try to visualize how much was added, changed, transformed. It’s kind of an ongoing experiment, and our discussion of interfaces at the Institute last July has helped me lots in thinking about what we’ll do with the reading interface.

The most interesting part of the [Digital Mitford project](http://digitalmitford.org) at the moment is the letters, but we’ll be releasing our drama module with a group of plays, and the reading interface here is going to help draw the visitor to find letters related to the plays, and tie related materials together. We also need to work out a good searchable interface for our prosopography index—and I think Flask will help a lot here! 

The [Pittsburgh Frankenstein project](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/) (currently just on GitHub), which I am pursuing together with [Rikk Mulligan](#rick-mulligan) and other colleagues, is a collation of four editions of *Frankenstein* that seeks to reconcile two very different ways to encode a novel: the diplomatic (to try to represent the marks on handwritten manuscript pages with page-by-page attention to where margin notes sit, insertions, deletions, changing hands) and the simpler structural encoding we use for print editions of the novel. We were figuring this out during the Institute, and now (since October) we have worked out a way to reconcile these and get CollateX to show us how they align. For samples of aligned output see

In the [e-PVL](http://pvl.obdurodon.org/browser.xhtml), I use CollateX to create a word-level alignment of variant readings. The digital [Codex Suprasliensis](http://suprasliensis.obdurodon.org/) is a fairly traditional diplomatic/facsimile edition. For something more original, which uses graphic visualization to represent and explore themes across linguistic traditions, see the [Digenis Akritis: Greek and Slavic](http://digenis.obdurodon.org/) and [Daniel the Prisoner: A virtual florilegium](http://zatochnik.obdurodon.org/). The texts at the [Annotated Afanas′ev library](http://aal.obdurodon.org/) form a pedagogical edition, with linguistic and folkloric annotations.

## Gustavo Fernández Riva

I am developing an edition of Konrad von Würzburg’s short stories. The aim is to design a synoptic view that allows to explore textual variation. The edition offers different possible views for each text (paleographic, regularized, etc.), and users can easily compare the witnesses using the columns and functions provided in the interface or the embedded [Traviz](http://www.traviz.vizcovery.org/) tool. Until I find a better home for it, it is hosted in <http://kvwdigital.000webhostapp.com/>. The documentation can be found on <https://github.com/GusRiva/konrad-von-wuerzburg>.

## Rikk Mulligan

I am one of the developers of The [Pittsburgh Frankenstein project](https://ebeshero.github.io/Pittsburgh_Frankenstein/), described above under the entry for [Elisa Beshero-Bondar](#elisa-beshero-bondar).
